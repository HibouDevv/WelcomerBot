<h1>WelcomerBot - Privacy Policy</h1>

Last Updated: July 26, 2025
<br>
This Privacy Policy explains how WelcomerBot ("we", "our", or "the bot") handles data when used in your Discord server. We value user privacy and aim to be as transparent as possible.
<h2>1. What Data We Collect</h2>

WelcomerBot only collects minimal data necessary for its functionality. This includes:
<ul>
    <li>Server ID and name – to identify where the bot is active</li>

    <li>Channel ID – for sending welcome messages</li>

    <li>User ID – for welcoming and assigning roles</li>

    <li>Timestamps – for tracking when a user joins (if needed for logs or statistics)</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. What We Do Not Collect</h2>

We do not collect or store:
<ul>
    <li>Message content</li>

    <li>Usernames, nicknames, avatars</li>

    <li>Personal information such as email, location, age, or passwords</li>

    <li>Direct messages between users</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. How We Use the Data</h2>

We use the collected data only to:
<ul>
    <li>Send welcome messages to new members</li>

    <li>Assign roles (coming soon!)</li>
</ul>

We do not use data for marketing, analytics, or profiling.
<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Data may be stored temporarily in memory while the bot is running.</li>
    <li>We do not maintain long-term databases unless explicitly stated in future updates.</li>
    <li>If persistent storage is added later (e.g. for welcome logs), it will be encrypted and secured.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

WelcomerBot does not share data with third-party services, advertisers, or analytics platforms.
<h2>6. User Control & Data Deletion</h2>

If you're a server owner:
<ul>
    <li>You can remove the bot at any time to stop data collection.</li>
    <li>Contact us to request deletion of any stored server-related data (if applicable in future versions).</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>

WelcomerBot does not knowingly collect information from users under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you are not even allowed to use Discord. All use of the bot must comply with Discord’s minimum age requirement.
<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. If major changes are made, we’ll announce them in our official support server or documentation.
